Everything I do is calculated. Oh no.
Can you spit faster?
Everything is dead. Just how I like it.
With how fall these things fast
Slapping my paint all over the place
The game is asking for genocide, of course we'll do good
I wasn't expecting to be smashed so hard
That's when I want to shoot her, when she's sucking in
Now I have to figure out how to kill myself
Family friendly genocide, that's what we do here
I like getting rewarded for murder
"I died for you!" "It's okay, your sacrifice was probably in vain"
Give me one second to fix the sun
Life is about trial and error; Dark Souls is mostly about error
I'm confident about drinking here
We can relax and chill
It’s time for our favorite game of ‘Walk Off, or Fuck Off’
I think I'd rather do dark souls than more exams
I've got spat on, thank you for that
