Everything I do is calculated. Oh no.
Can you spit faster?
Everything is dead. Just how I like it.
With how fall these things fast
Slapping my paint all over the place
The game is asking for genocide, of course we'll do good
I wasn't expecting to be smashed so hard
That's when I want to shoot her, when she's sucking in
Now I have to figure out how to kill myself
Family friendly genocide, that's what we do here
I like getting rewarded for murder
"I died for you!" "It's okay, your sacrifice was probably in vain"
Give me one second to fix the sun
Life is about trial and error; Dark Souls is mostly about error
I'm confident about drinking here
We can relax and chill *unholy roaring*
It’s time for our favorite game of ‘Walk Off, or Fuck Off’
I think I'd rather do dark souls than more exams
I've been spat on, thank you for that
Hug the crotch
I was distracted looking at her assets
The big weapons make me happy
I was scared, I'm still scared
Why does walking into this seem like a bad idea.... No, it's fine
I can steal from the slaves, thanks!
I'm the badder bitch of the two of us
Bitches love cannons and boys love tanks
I love getting rewarded for destruction
*animal cruelty* It's okay, they like it
Maybe there's an enemy I can kill and ride
This is the best Task manager stream I’ve seen in a while, music fits perfectly
I refuse to allow you to live, you upset me
Don't be scared to be hit by a rock
Are you dead yet?
apparently I'm farther and farther away, it's probably because I'm going the wrong way
The water has no ripples, this game is literally unplayable
I can hear the sounds of my next victims
They're lit up now, time to kill
I always appreciate a good drug
just collecting the heads of your friends, don't mind me
I don't appreciate being blinded
