Everything I do is calculated. Oh no.
Can you spit faster?
Everything is dead. Just how I like it.
Slapping my paint all over the place
The game is asking for genocide, of course we'll do good
I wasn't expecting to be smashed so hard
That's when I want to shoot her, when she's sucking in
Now I have to figure out how to kill myself
Family friendly genocide, that's what we do here
I like getting rewarded for murder
Bacon: "I died for you!" Dan: "It's okay, your sacrifice was probably in vain"
Give me one second to fix the sun
Life is about trial and error; Dark Souls is mostly about error
I'm confident about drinking here
We can relax and chill *unholy roaring*
It’s time for our favorite game of ‘Walk Off, or Fuck Off’
I think I'd rather do Dark Souls than more exams
I've been spat on, thank you for that
Hug the crotch
I was distracted looking at her assets
The big weapons make me happy
I was scared, I'm still scared
Why does walking into this seem like a bad idea.... No, it's fine
I can steal from the slaves, thanks!
I'm the badder bitch of the two of us
Bitches love cannons and boys love tanks
I love getting rewarded for destruction
*noises of animal cruelty* It's okay, they like it
Maybe there's an enemy I can kill and ride
I refuse to allow you to live, you upset me
Don't be scared to be hit by a rock
Are you dead yet?
Apparently I'm getting farther and farther away. It's probably because I'm going the wrong way
The water has no ripples, this game is literally unplayable
I can hear the sounds of my next victims
They're lit up now, time to kill
I always appreciate a good drug
I'm just collecting the heads of your friends, don't mind me
I don't appreciate being blinded
Genocide is a passion
I'mma go steal panties
Dan: "What was the point in making LOVE?" Abi: "There's always a point to making love ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)"
“-and then we punch into the chicken”
“Naturally, the solution to every problem is fisting.”
"please just kill me!"
